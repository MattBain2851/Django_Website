# Django_Website
This is the website that I, along with 4 others, created in CS3240. Do not use this code without permission. I recieved permission from my group members. 
It was created using Django, written in python and HTML and hosted on heroku servers. We also used travis, a continuous integration system, to help with the deployment.
